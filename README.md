# ML_1st_project
Model that predicts price of the houses in Tashkent city based on its location, size, rooms and what level it's on.Used CRSIP-DM methodolgy
This is the first model I did work on from sratch. Prepared the data and tried it on LinearRegression, Random Forest ,Decision Tree Models and tested the errors.
Errors are not that small . Biggest point is that I did this for experience.
